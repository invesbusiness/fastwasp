title: Deploying with the Wasp CLI
---

Wasp CLI can deploy your full-stack application with only a single command.
The command automates the manual deployment process and is the recommended way of deploying Wasp apps.

## Supported Providers

Wasp supports automated deployment to the following providers:
- [Fly.io](#flyio) - they offer 5$ free credit each month
- Railway (coming soon, track it here [#1157](https://github.com/wasp-lang/wasp/pull/1157))

## Fly.io

:::note A Note on Free Tiers ðŸ’³
Fly has [free allowances](https://fly.io/docs/about/pricing/#plans) for up to 3 VMs (so deploying a Wasp app to a fresh account is free), but all plans require you to add your credit card info before proceeding. If you don't, the deployment will fail.

You can add the necessary credit card info on the [account's billing page](https://fly.io/dashboard/personal/billing).
:::

Using the Wasp CLI, you can easily deploy a new app to [Fly.io](https://fly.io) with just a single command:
```shell
wasp deploy fly launch my-wasp-app mia
```

Under the covers, this runs the equivalent of the following commands:
```shell
wasp deploy fly setup my-wasp-app mia
wasp deploy fly create-db mia
wasp deploy fly deploy
```

The commands above use the app basename `my-wasp-app` and deploy it to the _Miami, Florida (US) region_ (called `mia`).

The basename is used to create all three app tiers, resulting in three separate apps in your Fly dashboard:

- `my-wasp-app-client`
- `my-wasp-app-server`
- `my-wasp-app-db`

:::caution Unique Name
Your app name must be unique across all of Fly or deployment will fail. Additionally, please do not CTRL-C or exit your terminal while the commands are running.
:::

You can find the list of all available Fly regions [here](https://fly.io/docs/reference/regions/).
Another way to see the same list is running `flyctl platform regions`.


## Options Reference

### Setup & Create DB

`setup` will create your client and server apps on Fly, and add some secrets, but does _not_ deploy them. We need a database first, which we create with `create-db`, and it is automatically linked to your server.

:::note
The `setup` and `create-db` should only be executed once.
:::

After running `setup`, Wasp creates two new files in your project root directory: `fly-server.toml` and `fly-client.toml`.
You should include these files in your version control.

If you want to maintain multiple apps, you can add the `--fly-toml-dir <abs-path>` option to point to different directories, like "dev" or "staging".

### Deploy

After the setup, we run `deploy` which will push your client and server live.

Run this command whenever you want to **update your deployed app** with the latest changes:
```shell
wasp deploy fly deploy
```

:::note
Fly.io offers support for both **locally** built Docker containers and **remotely** built ones. However, for simplicity and reproducibility, the CLI defaults to the use of a remote Fly.io builder.

If you want to build locally, supply the `--build-locally` option to `wasp deploy fly launch` or `wasp deploy fly deploy`.
:::

###  Environment Variables

If you are deploying an app that requires any other environment variables (like social auth secrets), here's how to set them up:

- During `launch`:
  ```
  wasp deploy fly launch my-wasp-app mia --server-secret GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<...> --server-secret GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<...>
  ```

- After `launch`/`setup`:
  ```
  wasp deploy fly cmd secrets set GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<...> GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<...> --context=server
  ```

### Running Fly Commands

If want to run arbitrary Fly commands (e.g. `flyctl secrets list` for your server app), here's how to do it:
```shell
wasp deploy fly cmd secrets list --context server
```

### Mutliple Fly Organizations

If you have multiple organizations, you can specify a `--org` option. For example: `wasp deploy fly launch my-wasp-app mia --org hive`
