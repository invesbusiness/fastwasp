Wasp comes with the Wasp language server, which gives supported editors powerful support and integration with the language. Currently, Wasp only supports integration with VSCode.

## VSCode

Install the [Wasp language extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wasp-lang.wasp) to get syntax highlighting and integration with the Wasp language server.
