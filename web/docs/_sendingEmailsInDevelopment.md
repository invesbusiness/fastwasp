:::info Sending emails while developing

When you run your app in development mode, the emails are not actually sent. Instead, they are logged to the console.

In order to enable sending emails in development mode, you need to set the `SEND_EMAILS_IN_DEVELOPMENT` env variable to `true` in your `.env.server` file.
