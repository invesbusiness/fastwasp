When a user logs in using a social login provider, the backend receives information about the user. Wasp provides a way to use this data through the `getUserFieldsFn` function. For instance, you can add a `displayName` property to your User entity and assign it using the details of the provider account.

Wasp also allows you to customize the configuration of the providers' settings using the `configFn` function.
